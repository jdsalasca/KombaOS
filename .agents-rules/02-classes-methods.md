Classes and methods
- Keep classes small and purpose-driven.
- Keep methods short and single-purpose.
- Avoid deep inheritance trees and superclasses.
- Use composition and delegation instead.

Do
- Extract pure functions when possible.
- Name methods by behavior, not implementation.

Don’t
- Don’t hide complex logic in constructors.
- Don’t mix validation, persistence, and rules in one method.
