Multi-agent collaboration
- Announce the files you will edit before making changes.
- Avoid concurrent edits on the same files.
- Keep commits scoped to a single intent.
- Do not push or commit other agents’ local changes.
- Rebase or merge frequently to reduce conflicts.
- Prefer sequential merges over parallel rewrites.

Coordination rules
- Update AGENTS.md when new shared rules are added.
- Keep file ownership explicit in PR descriptions.
- Leave the working tree clean after finishing a task.
