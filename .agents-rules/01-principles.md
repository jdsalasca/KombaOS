Core principles
- SRP: each module and class has one clear reason to change.
- OCP: extend behavior without modifying existing code.
- LSP: derived types must be safely substitutable.
- ISP: prefer small, focused interfaces.
- DIP: depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

Modular design
- Split by domain and responsibility.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid global state unless explicitly required.
